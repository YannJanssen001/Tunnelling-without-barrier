Quantum Tunnelling Without a Barrier - KURF Summer Work + Third Year Project 2025

**Third Year Project (what to look at / plan):**
working on ionisation, looking into the full photoelectron momentum distributions (adding a y component to the momentum) - for w and 2w field configuration
also add polarisation in y, making it co-linearly polarised, orthogonal two colour - for w and 2w field configuration
extending the analysis to additional phase shifts between the two constituent field.
w and 3w field, w and 4w field configuration.

**Summer King's Undergraduate Research Fellowship (KURF):**

This project investigates electron behavior during quantum tunnel ionization with and without a potential barrier, using numerical simulations based on the Strong-Field Approximation to calculate semi-classical trajectories. By examining electron motion under intense laser fields, it reveals surprising tunneling eventsâ€”particularly when the electric field momentarily vanishesâ€”while providing deeper insights into attosecond science, high-harmonic generation, and the fundamental mechanisms of quantum tunneling, challenging conventional interpretations of the Coulomb potential.
