X### Project description

[put here in one line what you're trying to do / the title of your project]
-what to look at / plan:

- working on ionisation, looking into the full photoelectron momentum distributions (adding a *y* component to the momentum) - for w and 2w field configuration
- also add polarisation in y, making it co-linearly polarised, orthogonal two colour -  for w and 2w field configuration
- extending the analysis to additional phase shifts between the two constituent field.
- w and 3w field, w and 4w field configuration.
